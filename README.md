 Hi, I’m @codecaf-edu

👀 I’m interested in coding education, technology, and fostering a supportive learning community.

🌱 I’m currently learning about new programming languages, instructional design principles, and innovative teaching methodologies.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on educational projects, coding workshops, and creating engaging learning resources.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach out to me via email at contact@codecaf.com or connect with me on www.codecaf.com

😄 Pronouns: code/everday

⚡ Fun fact: I love experimenting with new coding frameworks and exploring the intersection of technology and education. Did you know that the first computer virus was created in 1983 by a high school student as a practical joke?
